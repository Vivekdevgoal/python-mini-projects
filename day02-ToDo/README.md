# 📝 To-Do List Application (Python)

## 📌 Description
This is a simple command-line based **To-Do List application** built using Python.  
The program allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, with all tasks being stored persistently in a text file.  
It demonstrates basic CRUD operations and introduces file handling for data persistence.

## 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks to the to-do list
- View all existing tasks with numbering
- Delete tasks using task number
- Persistent storage using a text file
- Menu-driven user interface
- Input validation to prevent crashes

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in `os` module
- Text file storage (`.txt`)

## 🐍 Python Concepts Used
- Functions and modular programming
- Lists and list operations
- File handling (`open`, read, write)
- `os.path.exists()` for file checking
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Conditional statements
- Exception handling (`try` / `except`)
- Enumerate function
- Global variables
- `__main__` entry point

## 🧠 New Things Learned
- How to store and retrieve data using files
- Implementing persistent data storage in Python
- Structuring a program using functions
- Managing user choices using a menu-driven approach
- Safely deleting list items using index validation
- Separating logic into reusable functions
- Understanding program flow using a main controller function

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Mark tasks as completed or pending
- Add task priorities and deadlines
- Store tasks using JSON instead of a text file
- Improve input validation and error messages
- Add search and edit functionality
