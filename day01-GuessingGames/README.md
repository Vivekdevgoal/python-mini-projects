# 🎯 Guessing Games in Python

## 📌 Description
This project contains two simple command-line games implemented in Python:
1. **Number Guessing Game** – the user guesses a randomly generated number.
2. **Letter Guessing Game** – the user guesses a randomly selected alphabet letter.

Both games are designed to improve logical thinking, user input handling, and basic control flow in Python. Each game is implemented in a separate Python file within the same folder.

## 🚀 Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Random letter selection from a–z
- User-friendly prompts and feedback
- Maximum attempt limit (5 tries)
- Input validation to handle incorrect inputs
- Displays total attempts taken by the user
- Simple and interactive command-line interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in `random` module

## 🐍 Python Concepts Used
- Variables and data types
- `while` loops
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Exception handling (`try` / `except`)
- User input handling (`input()`)
- Type casting (`int()`)
- String methods (`lower()`, `isalpha()`)
- Comparison operators
- Importing standard libraries

## 🧠 New Things Learned
- How to generate random numbers and letters using the `random` module
- Handling invalid user input using exception handling
- Limiting attempts in a loop-based game
- Comparing user input with randomly generated values
- Writing interactive programs that respond dynamically to user actions
- Improving program flow using `break` and `continue`

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Allow users to replay the game without restarting the program
- Add score tracking across multiple rounds
- Create a menu to choose between number guessing and letter guessing
- Convert the game into a GUI-based application
