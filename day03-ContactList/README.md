# 📇 Contact List Application (Python)

## 📌 Description
This project is a **command-line based Contact List application** built using Python.  
It allows users to add, view, and delete contacts, where each contact contains a name, phone number, and email ID.  
The contact data is stored persistently using a JSON file, making the application suitable for understanding structured data storage.

## 🚀 Features
- Add new contacts with phone number and email ID
- View all saved contacts in a formatted manner
- Delete contacts by name
- Persistent storage using a JSON file
- Menu-driven interface for easy interaction
- Simple validation for empty contact lists

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in `os` module
- Built-in `json` module
- JSON file storage (`.json`)

## 🐍 Python Concepts Used
- Dictionaries and nested dictionaries
- File handling with JSON (`json.load`, `json.dump`)
- `os.path.exists()` for file checking
- Functions and modular programming
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Conditional statements
- Global variables
- Dictionary operations (add, delete, iterate)
- `__main__` entry point

## 🧠 New Things Learned
- How to store structured data using JSON format
- Difference between text file storage and JSON storage
- Reading and writing dictionary data to files
- Working with nested data structures
- Managing application state using global variables
- Implementing CRUD operations using dictionaries
- Building reusable menu-driven applications

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add contact search functionality
- Update or edit existing contact details
- Add duplicate contact name validation
- Sort contacts alphabetically
- Add phone number and email format validation
