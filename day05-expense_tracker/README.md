# 💰 Expense Tracker Application (Python)

## 📌 Description
This project is a **command-line based Expense Tracker** built using Python.  
It allows users to record daily expenses, categorize them, view expense history, and analyze spending patterns using statistical summaries and visualizations.  
The project introduces data analysis concepts using NumPy and Matplotlib along with file-based data persistence.

## 🚀 Features
- Add, view, and delete expenses
- Categorize expenses
- Store expenses persistently using JSON files
- View daily and monthly expense summaries
- Identify maximum expense spent at once
- Visualize daily expenses using bar charts
- Visualize category-wise expenses using pie charts
- Menu-driven interface for easy navigation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in `json` and `os` modules
- `datetime` module
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🐍 Python Concepts Used
- Lists and dictionaries
- File handling with JSON
- Functions and modular programming
- Exception handling
- Loops and conditional statements
- Data aggregation using dictionaries
- List comprehensions
- Working with external libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Data visualization concepts
- `__main__` entry point

## 🧠 New Things Learned
- Designing a complete data-driven application
- Storing and processing expense data for analysis
- Performing numerical operations using NumPy
- Aggregating data by date and category
- Creating visual representations of data
- Understanding real-world use of Python in finance tracking
- Structuring larger Python programs with multiple features

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add category management (create/delete categories)
- Validate date formats using `datetime`
- Add yearly expense analysis
- Export reports to CSV or Excel
- Add budget limits and alerts
- Convert the project into a GUI or web-based application
